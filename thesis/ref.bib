  abstract     = {{WASH}/{CGI} is an embedded domain-specific language for server-side Web scripting. Due to its reliance on the strongly typed, purely functional programming language Haskell as a host language, it is highly flexible and---at the same time---it provides extensive guarantees due to its pervasive use of type information.{WASH}/{CGI} can be structured into a number of sublanguages addressing different aspects of the application. The
                  document sublanguage
                  provides tools for the generation of parameterized {XHTML} documents and forms. Its typing guarantees that almost all generated documents are valid {XHTML} documents. The
                  session sublanguage
                  provides a session abstraction with a transparent notion of session state and allows the composition of documents and Web forms to entire interactive scripts. Both are integrated with the
                  widget sublanguage
                  which describes the communication (parameter passing) between client and server. It imposes a simple type discipline on the parameters that guarantees that forms posted by the client are always understood by the server. That is, the server never asks for data not submitted by the client and the data submitted by the client has the type requested by the server. In addition, parameters are received in their typed internal representation, not as strings. Finally, the
                  persistence sublanguage
                  deals with managing shared state on the server side as well as individual state on the client side. It presents shared state as an abstract data type, where the script can control whether it wants to observe mutations due to concurrently executing scripts. It guarantees that states from different interaction threads cannot be confused.},
